IOIO - CurrentCost bridge
=========================

A basic app to receive electricity consumption data from a CurrentCost 128 / ENVI (and possibly ENVIR) device via a IOIO board to an Android device.

NOTE: At the moment it's not working properly, receiving serial data overloads the buffer so not recommended for cloning unless you want to help me out :)
